# Datasheet-derived regression requirements.
#
# Workflow:
# 1) Run: python tools/extract_datasheet_requirements.py --pdf "eyeSight Datasheet.pdf"
# 2) Review/edit the generated candidates in requirements/eyesight_candidates.yaml
# 3) Copy the ones you want to enforce into this file and fill in metric/type/expected
# 4) Run: pytest
#
# Each item must have a stable `id` so it can be tracked over time.
